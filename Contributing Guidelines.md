# Contributing Guidelines

SnapshotTest is open source and contributions are very welcome. Read the short list below and follow it as closely as you can.

## Corner Stones

* **Tested**. Wether by TDD or not there will be tests for as much of the source as possible. Tests will also serve as documentation for the expected behavior.
* **Readable**. Implementations will be made with the simplest viable solution. The elegant solution is preferred over the obfuscated.
* **Swift**. Source files for the tool are built entirely in Swift.
* **No dependencies for the integrating project**. Everything needed to use this tool must be contained in this tool.
